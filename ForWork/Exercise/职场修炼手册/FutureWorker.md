对于修炼手册的认知：这是否是正确的道路       
1，知识在不断的迭代发展，永远保持一颗学习的心。才能在新出现的一切知识中找到道路，走上了计算机之路，就走上了一条知识创造的道路，在这条路上，不仅要学会基本原理是什么，在原理的指导下应该怎么操作，可能会出现什么问题，应该怎么解决。    
2，消除计算机领域的神秘感和隔阂感，这一切都是人类创造出来的，学习的过程，就是去猜想，然后收集资料，验证自己的猜想，一切都是围绕着这一核心科学来进行的，一切什么语言，什么IDE，什么终端，都是其具体下面的一种体现。Someone do this job means that it is a connection to connect with the physical world.as a beginner,it is my duty to know what happens behind the face.i should communicate with the big boss by different ways to preview what will happen in the future.     
3，What will happen on this way,and how to deal with it.on this way,what will happen,how many problems on this way,how do people deal with it, it is just like a mathmetic problems on this way,it is amazing to deal with this problem.将整个过程变成一种智慧的拓展而不是只是为了掌握一项工作的技能，any language is just a tool about the true computer world.一切都是为了揭露计算机的本质。    
4，开发一个模型，寻找一种方式，如何切入到任何一个时空之中。
